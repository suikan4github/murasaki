     *   the I2C clocks as clock master.
     *
     *   The fs parameter is the sampling frequency of the CODEC in Hz. This parameter is limited as
     *   one of the following :

     *   @li 32000
     *   @li 48000

     *   @li 44100
     *   @li 88200
     *
     *   The master_clock parameter is the MCLK input to the ADAU1361 in Hz.
     *   This parameter must be one of followings :

     *   Note : Only 8, 12, 13, 14.4, 12.288MHz are tested.

     *   The analog signals are routed as following :
     *   @li Line In  : LINN/RINN single ended.
     *   @li Aux In : LAUX/RAUX input
     *   @li LINE out : LOUTP/ROUTP single ended
