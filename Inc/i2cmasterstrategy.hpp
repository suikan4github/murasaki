 * \brief Definition of the root class of I2C master.
 * \details
 * A prototype of the I2C master peripheral.
 *
 * This prototype assumes the derived class will transmit / receive data in the
 * task context on RTOS. And these member functions should be synchronous.
 * That mean, until the transmit / receive
 * terminates, both method don't return.
 *
 * Two call back member functions are prepared to sync with the interrupt which tells the end of
 * Transmit/Receive.
