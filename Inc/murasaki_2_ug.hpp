/**
 *  \page murasaki_ug_usage Usage Introduction
 *  \details
 *  In this introduction, we see how to use the Murasaki class library in the STM32 program.
 *
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_1
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_2
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_3
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_4
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_5
 *  \li \subpage ug_sec_6
 *
 *  There are some other manuals of murasaki class library :
 *
 *  \li \ref murasaki_ug_preface
 *  \li \ref murasaki_pg
 *  \li \ref MURASAKI_GROUP
 *
 *
 *  For the easy-to-understand description, we assume several things on the application skeleton, which we are going to use Murasaki :
 *  \li The application skeleton is generated by <a href= "https://www.st.com/ja/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html"> CubeIDE </a>
 *  \li The application skeleton is configured to use FreeRTOS
 *  \li UART3 is configured to use DMA.
 *  @li UART3 is configured to use interrupt.
 *
 *  These are requirements from the Murasaki library.
 *
 *  \page ug_sec_1 Message output
 *  \details
 *  The Murasaki library has a Printf() like a message output mechanism.
 *  This mechanism is an easy way to display a message from an embedded microcomputer to the terminal simulator like Kermit on a host computer. Murasaki's Printf() is based on the standard C language formatting library. So, a programmer can output a message like standard printf().
 *
 *  As usual, let's start from "hello, world."
 *
 *  \code
 *  murasaki::debugger->Printf("Hello, world!\n");
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  In Murasaki manner, the Printf() is not a global function. This member function is a method of murasaki::Debugger class.
 *  The murasaki::debugger variable is one of the two Murasaki's global variables. And it provides an easy to use message output.
 *
 *  The end-of-line character depends on the terminal. In the above example, the terminator is '\n'.
 *  The '\n' is for the Linux based Kermit software. Other terminal systems may need other end-of-line characters.
 *  The easiest way to absorb this difference is to change the terminal software behavior.
 *  Almost terminal emulation software can accept any type of end-of-line character.
 *
 *  Because the Printf() works as like standard printf(), you can also use the format string.
 *
 *  \code
 *  murasaki::debugger->Printf("count is %d\n", count);
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  The Printf() is designed as a debugger message output for an embedded real-time system.
 *  This function is :
 *  \li Thread safe
 *  \li Asynchronous
 *  \li Blocking
 *  \li Buffered
 *
 *  In other words, you can use this function in either task or interrupt handler without bothering the real-time process.

/**
 * \page ug_sec_2 Serial communication
 * @details
 * murasaki::Uart is the asynchronous serial communication.
 * The initial baud rate, parity and data size are defined by CubeIDE.
 * So, there is no need to initialize the communication parameter in application program.
 * User can transmit data by passing its buffer address and data length.
 *
 *
 * @code
 *        uint8_t data[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
 *        murasaki::UartStatus stat;
 *
 *        stat = murasaki::platform.uart->Transmit(
 *                                                 data,
 *                                                 5);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition to the transmit function, also Receive() member function exists.

/**
 * \page ug_sec_3 Debugging with Murasaki.
 * \details
 * As we saw again and again, Murasaki has a simple messaging output for real-time debugging.
 * This feature is
 * typically used as UART serial output, but configurable by the programmer.
 *
 * The murasaki::debugger is the useful variable to output the debugging message.
 * There are several good features in this function, as we already saw.
 * \li Versatile printf() style format string.
 * \li Can call from both task and interrupt context
 * \li Asyncronous
 * \li Non-blocking
 *
 * These features help the programmer to display the message in the real-time, multi-task application.
 *
 * In addition to this simple debugging variable, a programmer can use assert_failure() function of the STM32 HAL.
 * The STM32Cube HAL has assert_failure() to check the parameter on the fly.
 * By default, this function is disabled.
 * To use this function, programmer have to make it enable, and add function to receive the
 * debug information.
 *
 * To enable the assert_failuer(), open the Project Management tab of the Device Configuration Tool of the CubeIDE.
 * And then, go to the Code Generation section and check "Enable Full Assert".
 *
 * And then, you must modify assert_failure() in main.c, to call output function
 * (Note, this modification is done by the murasaki/install script ).
 *
 * \code
 * void assert_failed(uint8_t* file, uint32_t line)
 * {
 *     CustomAssertFailed(file, line);  // debugging stub.
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * This hook calls CustomAssertFailed() function.
 *
 * \code
 * // Hook for the assert_failure() in main.c
 * void CustomAssertFailed(uint8_t* file, uint32_t line)
 * {
 *     murasaki::debugger->Printf("Wrong parameters value: file %s on line %d\n", file, line);
 * }
 *
 * \endcode
 * Once above programming is done, you can watch the integrity of the HAL parameter by
 * reading the console output.
 *
 * Above debugging mechanism redirects all HAL assertion, Murasaki assertion and
 * application debug message to the specified logging port.
 * That logging port is able to customize.
 * In this User's Guide, logging is done through the UART port.
 *
 * Sometimes, you may not want to connect a serial terminal to your system after you saw something wrong.
 * But this is too late because the assertion message is already transmitted ( and lost ).
 *
 * Murasaki can save this problem.
 * By adding the following code after creating murasaki::Debugger instance, you can use history functionality.
 *
 * @code
 *     murasaki::debugger->AutoHistory();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The murasaki::Debugger::AutoHistory() creates a dedicated task for auto history function.
 * This task watches the input from the logging port.
 * Again, in this User's guide it is UART.
 * Once any character is received from the logging port ( terminal ),
 * previously transmitted message is sent again.
 * Thus you can read the daying message from your application.
 *
 * The auto history is handy, but it blocks all input from the terminal.
 * If you want to have your own console program through the debug port input,
 * do not use the auto history. Alternatively, you can send the previously transmitted message again,
 * by calling murasaki::Debugger::PrintHistory() explicitly.
 *
 * Murasaki also have post-mortem debugging feature which helps to analyze severe error.
 * Murasaki adds a hook into the Default_Handler of the startup_stm32****.s file.
 *
 * @code
 *     .section  .text.Default_Handler,"ax",%progbits
 *     .global CustomDefaultHandler
 * Default_Handler:
 * #if (__ARM_ARCH == 6 )
 *   ldr r0, = CustomDefaultHandler
 *   bx r0
 * #else
 *   b.w CustomDefaultHandler
 * #endif
 * Infinite_Loop:
 *   b  Infinite_Loop
 * @endcode
 *
 * The inserted instructions supersedes the infinite loop at spurious interrupt handler.
 * Alternatively, CustomDefaultHandler() is called. The CustomDefaultHandler() stops entire
 * Debugger process, and get into the polling mode serial operation with auto history.
 *
 * That mean, once spurious interrupt happen, you can read the messages in the debug
 * message FIFO by pressing any key. This feature helps to analyze the assertion message
 * instead of the confusion by unknown trouble.
 *

/**
 * \page ug_sec_4 Tasking
 * @details
 * murasaki::SimpleTask is a wrapper class of the FreeRTOS task.
 * By using murasaki::SimpleTask, a programmer can easily create a task object.
 * This object encapsulates the task of the FreeRTOS.
 *
 * First of all, you must define a task body function.
 * Any function name is acceptable, Only the return type and parameter type is specified.
 *
 *
 * @code
 * // Task body of the murasaki::platform.task1
 * void TaskBodyFunction(const void* ptr)
 *                       {
 *
 *     while (true)    // dummy loop
 *     {
 *         murasaki::platform.led2->Toggle();  // toggling LED
 *         murasaki::Sleep(700);
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then, create a Task object.
 *
 * There are several parameters to pass for the constructor.
 * The first parameter is the name of the task in FreeRTOS.
 * The second one is the task stack size. The programmer must decide the appropriate size based on the requirement of the task body function.
 * The third one is the priority of the new task.
 * The priority has to be the value of the @ref murasaki::TaskPriority type. The fourth one is the pointer to the task parameter. This parameter is passed to the task function body in the run-time.
 * And then, the last one is the pointer to the task body function.
 *
 * @code
 *     // For demonstration of FreeRTOS task.
 *     murasaki::platform.task1 = new murasaki::SimpleTask(
 *                                                   "Master",
 *                                                   256,
 *                                                   murasaki::ktpNormal,
 *                                                   nullptr,
 *                                                   &TaskBodyFunction
 *                                                   );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Once a task object is created, you must call Start() member function to start the task.
 *
 * @code
 *    murasaki::platform.task1->Start();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then, a new task starts.

/**
 * @page ug_sect_5_3 SPI Master
 * @details
 * @ref murasaki::SpiMaster is the SPI master class of Murasaki.
 * This class is more complicated than other peripherals because of its flexibility.
 * The SPI master controller must adapt to the several variations of the SPI communication.
 * \li CPOL configuration
 * \li CPHA configuration
 * \li GPIO port configuration to select a slave
 *
 * To support the above configurations, we need a special mechanism.
 * In Murasaki, this flexibility is the responsibility of the urasaki::SpiSlaveAdapter class.
 * This class holds these configurations and passes them to the I2C master class.
 *
 * So, you must create a murasaki::SpiSlaveAdapter class object, at first.
 * @code
 *         // Create a slave adapter. This object specify the protocol and slave select pin
 *         murasaki::SpiSlaveAdapterStrategy * slave_spec;
 *         slave_spec = new murasaki::SpiSlaveAdapter(

 *  In other words, this task is automatically created without configuration.

 *
 *  In this example, the first half of the InitPlatform() is building a murasaki::debugger variable.
 *
 *  Probably the most critical statement in this part is the creation of the DebuggerUart class object.
 *
 *  @code
 *     murasaki::platform.uart_console = new murasaki::DebuggerUart(&huart3);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  In this statement, the DebgguerUart receives the pointer to the huart3 as a parameter.
 *  The hauart3 is a handle variable of the UART3 generated by CubeIDE. Let's remind the  UART3 is utilized as a communication path through the USB in the Nucleo 144 board.
 *  So, in this sample code,  we are making debugging console through the USB-serial line of the Nucleo F722ZE board.
 *
 *  Because the huart3 is generated into the main.c directory, we have to declare this  variable as an external variable. You can find the declaration around the top of the
 *  Src/murasaki_platform.cpp.
 *
 *  @code
 *  extern UART_HandleTypeDef huart3;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Note that the UART port number depends on the  Nucleo board. So, the
 *  porting programmer have a responsibility to refer the right UART.
 *
 *  The second half of the InitPlatform() is the creative part of the other peripheral object. This part is fully depends on the application. A programmer can define any
 *  member variable in the platform variable, by modifying the murasaki::Platform struct in the Inc/platform_defs.hpp.
 *
 *  The second function which is called from the @ref StartDefaultTask() is the @ref ExecPlatform().
 *  This function is also defined in the @ref Src/murasaki_platform.cpp.
 *
 *
 *  @code
 *  void ExecPlatform()
 *  {
 *
 *      murasaki::platform.task1->Start();
 *
 *
 *      // print a message with counter value to the console.
 *      murasaki::debugger->Printf("Push user button to display the I2C slave device \n");
 *
 *
 *      // Loop forever
 *      while (true) {
 *          murasaki::platform.sync_with_button->Wait();
 *          I2cSearch(murasaki::platform.i2c_master);
 *
 *      }
 *  }
 *   @endcode
 *
 *  This function is the body of the application. So, you can read GPIO, ADC other peripherals.
 *  And output to the DAC, GPIO, and other peripherals from here.

/**
 * @page ug_sect_6_3 Spurious Interrupt flow
 * @details
 * Murasaki provides a mechanism to catch a spurious interrupt.
 * Default_handler is the entry point of the spurious interrupt handler.
 * This is defined in  startup/startup_stm32******.s.
 *
 * The install script modify this handler to call the pref CustomDefaultHanlder()
 * in the @ref Src/murasaki_platform.cpp.

 *   b  Infinite_Loop
 * @endcode
 *
 * CustomDefaultHandler() is an assembly program. Which pushes
 * register on the stack to allow the PrintFaultResult function
 * to print out the register and exception environment.
 * After printing, the system gets into the post-motem mode which
 * responses any key from the console and then flush out the contents of printf message FIFO.
 *
 * Note that the CustomDefaultHandler() works correctly only when  both conditions are met :
 * \li Core is ARM v7m ( The CORTEX-Mx except for M0, M0+ )
 * \li Murasaki is the release build.
 * \li The exception is Hard Fault.
 *
 * The Debug build makes an unexpected stack frame in the entry code of the HardFaultHandler.

/**
 * @page ug_sect_6_4 General Interrupt flow
 * @details
 *  As described in the HAL manual, STM32Cube HAL handles all interrupts relevant to the peripherals, and then, call the corresponding callback function.
 *  These callbacks are optional from the viewpoint of the peripheral hardware, but an essential hook to sync with the software.
 *
 *  Murasaki is using these callbacks to notify the end of processing, to the peripheral class objects.
 *  These callbacks are managed automatically. For example, the following is the UART RX completion call back inside @ref murasaki_callback.cpp.
 *
 *  @code
 * void HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback(UART_HandleTypeDef *huart)
 *                              {

 *     // Handle the callback by the object.
 *     uart->ReceiveCompleteCallback(huart);

 *
 *  This callback is called from HAL, after the end of peripheral interrupt processing. Then, the @ref murasaki::CallbackRepositorySingleton

/**
 * @page ug_sect_6_5 EXTI flow
 * @details
 * The EXTI flow is very similar to the @ref ug_sect_6_4 except its timing.
 *
 * By design, CubeIDE generated code enable the EXTI right after main calls MX_GPIO_Init().
 * This means EXTIs are accepted even before Murasaki prepare the interrupt routines.
 * If EXTI is accepted before Murasaki is ready, it will cause assertion failure.
 * To avoid it, Murasaki disable the interrupt callback handling in the HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback() until
 * first @ref Exti::Wait() is executed.
 *
 * So, all EXTI interrupt before the first Exti::Wait() call is ignored.
